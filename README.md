## HYBRID CONVOLUTIONAL NUERAL NETWORK AND VISION  TRANSFORMER TRANSFER LEARNING MODELS FOR EMOTION  RECOGINITION
We present a hybrid model that combines attention-based vision transformers with transfer learning and advanced convolutional layer-based transfer learning approaches as feature generators 
Internet real-world photos are utilised as input, and the FER2013 Dataset is used as a dataset. 
The facial image data consists of a 48x48-pixel grayscale picture. The public test set has 7178 examples, whereas the training set has 28,709 examples.
By combining the two deep learning techniques used in this caseâ€”the CNN model and attention-based vision transformers-we were able to reach an accuracy of 0.59 and was successful in detecting the different emotions in a facial image and divide them into 7 different classes such as sad, happy and so on.
